Types of applications 
=====================
We have two types of applications.

1) Client Based Applications 

2) Web Based Applications 


1) Client Based Applications
----------------------------
Applications which need to be install in a user's computer are called client based applications.

Applications which are running in a user's computer are called client based applications.

All client based applications are ruled out.

ex:
	VLC Media Player 


2) Web Based Applications
-------------------------
Applications which can be access from where every over the network are called web based applications.
ex:
	Facebook
	Instagram
	Amazon 
	and etc.


Q) How can we develop an application accessible by thousands for users?

First we need to develop our application and later we need to host our application on top of the server.

Q) What is the difference between PC and Server?

PC						Server
------						-------
It is specially designed for perticular		It is designed to operate multiple 
user.						user's.

It contains simple structure.			It contains complex structure.

It contains less storage from gegabytes to 	It contains large storage from 
terabytes.					terabytes to petabytes.

Low network capability.				High network capability.

It contains single processor.			It contains multiple processors.		

Q) Will company use one server or multiple servers?

It depends on the scale of a company and companies revenue is completely depend upon servers so they must ensure that these servers are operating all the times.

To host any application on top of the server we need infrastructure.

Every It company having their own data center.

Data center is a place where we can host our servers.

Q) Is it easy to maintain the data center?

No, It is not easy to maintain the data center specially to startup's because it is capital intensive.

We required following things to build the data center.

1) Server Maintainence Team 

2) Private and Secure place.

3) Dual Power supply 

4) Dual Network (ISP)

5) Need to follow geographical standards to secure customer data over the network and 
   physically.

6) Hardware Refresh 

and etc.

To overcome above limitation we need to use cloud concepts.


Cloud Computing 
===============
Cloud computing is a on demand delivery of IT resources with pay-as-you-go model.

Cloud concept started in the year of 2004.

We have following list of cloud providers.

ex:
	Cloud Provider		Cloud
	--------------		--------
	Oracle			OCI - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 
	Amazon			AWS - Amazon Web Services
	Microsoft		Azure
	Google			GCP - Google Cloud Platform 
	IBM			IBM Cloud 
	Alibaba 		Alibaba Cloud 
	and etc.	

AWS 
====
AWS stands for Amazon Web Services.

It is on-demand cloud computing platform, offering over 200 services like storage, databases, servers, AI, and analytics over the internet.

AWS was developed in the year of 2004.

It was monopoly almost for 10 years. 

In short AWS was the leader for 10 years.


Cloud Business Models/Service Models 
=====================================
Every cloud provider supports three cloud business models.

1) IaaS (Infrastructure As a Service)

2) PaaS (Platform As a Service)

3) SaaS (Software As a Service)

They comes with and ends with shared responsibility model.

Some group of expertise engineers in a company decide which business model is best for their business.
