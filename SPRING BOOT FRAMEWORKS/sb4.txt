RestController
==============
It is used to create Restful Web Services using @RestController annotation.

@RestController is a class level annotation and allows a class to intercept all incoming requests.

@RestController annotation is a combination of two annotations i.e @Controller and @ResponseBody.

We have following list of Rest Annotations.
ex:
	HTTP Method		Annotation 
	-----------		----------
	GET			@GetMapping 
	POST			@PostMapping 
	PUT			@PutMapping 
	DELETE			@DeleteMapping 
	and etc.	

ex:					ex:
---					---
@Controller				@RestController
class  HomeController			class HomeController
{					{
	@RequestMapping("/msg")			@GetMapping("/msg")	
	@ResponseBody				public String home()
	public String home()			{
	{						return "Hi";
		return "Hi";			}
	}				}
}

step1:
-----
	Create a spring starter project i.e FourthSB.
	ex:
		Spring Web 

step2:
------
	Create a "com.ihub.www.controller" package inside "src/main/java".

step3:
-----
	Create a HomeController.java file inside "com.ihub.www.controller" package.

HomeController.java
------------------
package com.ihub.www.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/home")
public class HomeController 
{
	//handler method 
	@GetMapping("/msg")
	public String home()
	{
		return "Welcome to Spring Boot";
	}
}

step4:
-----	
	Rename application.properties file to application.yml file.

step5:
-----
	Configure application name and server port inside application.yml file.

application.yml
---------------
spring:
  application:
    name: FourthSB 
server:
  port: 9191

step6:
-----
	Run spring boot starter project.
step7:
-----
	Test the application by using below request url.
	ex:
		http://localhost:9191/home/msg

Q) What is the difference between Monolithic Architecture vs Microservice Architecture?

Monolithic Architecture 
-----------------------
Monolithic architecture is a software design pattern where all application components are tightly coupled and built as a single, unified unit. 

In monolithic architecture we develop independent services and at the end of the development we pack all the services into a single war file. Later we deploy that war file in a server. 

Diagram: sb4.1

Advantages:

1) Simple to Develop 

2) Simple to Deploy 

3) Simple to Test 

Disadvantages:

1) Large and Complex applications 

2) It blocks contineous development 

3) Slow Development 

4) Inflexible 

5) Inreliable 

Microservice Architecture 
-------------------------
Microservice is a software development approach in which a large and complex application break downs into small or mini services where each service contains business compabilities.

Diagram: sb4.2

Advantages:

1) Independent development 

2) Independent deployment 

3) Granular Scaling

4) Mix Technology stack

5) Fault Tolerance 


Creating Microservice using Spring Boot 
=======================================
To create a microservice using spring boot we need to follow spring boot flow layered architecture.

It is recommanded to take microservice name in lowercase.
