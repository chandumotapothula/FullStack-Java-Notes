Limitations with Spring Framework 
=================================
In spring framework , a programmer is responsible for following things.

1) Adding the dependencies or jar files.

2) Performing configurations inside applicationContext.xml file.

3) Arranging physical server like Tomcat.

4) Managing physical database like Oracle.

To ovecome these above limitations we need to use Spring Boot.

ex:
		Developer
		   |
		   |
		Spring Boot 
		   |
		   |
		Spring Framework  

Spring Boot 
===========
It is a java based application framework developed by Pivotal Team.

It provides RAD (Rapid Application Development) features for spring based applications.

It is standalone , production ready grade spring based applications with minimum configurations. 

In short spring boot is a combination of 

ex:
	Spring Framework + Embedded Server + Embedded Database



Advantages of Spring Boot 
=========================
1) It does not support xml configurations instead we will use annotations.

2) We can develop standalone application which can be run by using java -jar.

3) It provides optionate starters to simplify the maven development process.

4) It provides production ready grade features like metrics, Healthcheck, externalized configurations and etc.

5) It helps to test the web application by using HTTP servers like Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow.

6) It gives in-memory databases like H2, HSQL and Derby.

7) It contains CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for developing and testing spring boot application.


Interview Questions 
===================
1) How many components are there in spring boot?

We have four components in spring boot.

1) Autoconfiguration 

2) Starters 

3) Actuators 

4) CLI Tool 




Q) What is dependency injection?

It is a design pattern in which objects will recieve their dependencies from external source rather then creating them internally. 

It promotes loose coupling, easy testing and better code maintainability.

It is a programming technique which makes our class independent to it's dependencies.

To perform dependency injection in spring boot we need to use @Autowired annotation.

ex:
	class Student 
	{
		@Autowired
		Recording r;
	}
	class Recording 
	{
		- // some logic 
	}

Q) Ways to create spring boot application?

There are two ways to create spring boot application.

1) Using Spring Intializr 

2) Using IDE's (Spring Tool Suit / Intellij) 


Spring Intializr
=================
It is a web based tool for creating spring boot project structure.

It creates spring boot project structure in a zip file.

We need to extract that zip and must open in a IDE.

To use spring initializr we need to use below link.
ex:
	https://start.spring.io
	
STS 
======
Environment		:	Java

Format			:	Zip 

Download link		:	https://spring.io/tools


Steps to develop first spring boot application 
==============================================

Project Structure 
-----------------
FirstSB 
|
|---src/main/java
	|
	|---com.ihub.www (base pkg)
		|	
		|---FirstSbApplication.java
 
|---src/main/resources
	|
	|---application.properties

|---src/test/java
|
|---pom.xml 


step1:
------
	Launch STS IDE by choosing workspace location.

step2:
------
	Create a spring starter project i.e FirstSB.
	ex:
		File --> new --> Spring Starter Project --> 
		Name : FirstSB
		Type : Maven		packaging : jar 
		Java Version : 17 	Language : Java 
		Group : com.ihub.www
		Artifact : FirstSB 
		Description : Demo project for Spring Boot
		package : com.ihub.www 
		--> next --> next --> finish.
	
step3:
-----
	Write custom logic inside "FirstSbApplication.java" file.

FirstSbApplication.java
-----------------------
package com.ihub.www;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class FirstSbApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		SpringApplication.run(FirstSbApplication.class, args);
		
		System.out.println("I Love Spring Boot");
	}

}

step4:
------
	Run spring boot starter project.
	ex:
		Right click to FirstSB (project) --> run as --> spring boot app.

  


Q) What is @SpringBootApplication annotation?

This annotation is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application. 

It is a combination of three annotations.

1) @EnableAutoConfiguration 
--------------------------
	It is used to enable auto configuration mechanism in spring boot.

2) @ComponentScan 
-------------
	It is used to scan on packages in which our project is located.

3) @Configuration 
-----------------
	It is used to add extra beans to context.
	It is used to perform extra configurations.
