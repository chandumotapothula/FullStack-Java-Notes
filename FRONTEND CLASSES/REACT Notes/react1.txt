ReactJS 
========
It is a declarative, efficient and flexible javascript frontend library which is used to develop web applications and User interfaces.

It is an open source, component based frontend library responsible only for view layer of the application.

It is developed by Jordan Walke a popular scientist of Facebook.

It is intially developed by Facebook and later it is used in their own products like whatsapp and instagram.

It is released to the public in the month of May,2013.

The official website of reactjs is https://react.dev . 

The latest version of react i.e v19.2

The main objective of react is used to develop reusable components.

A component is a building block of react application.


Advantages
===========
1) It is easy to learn and easy to use.

2) It is used to develop reusable components.

3) It uses virtual DOM.

4) It supports one way data binding.

5) Good documentation and community support.

How React works internally
==========================
React internally uses virtual DOM that is tree node representation.

Whenever we insert or delete the elements in DOM , react uses virtual DOM.

React uses/find out efficient way to perform the changes in the real DOM.

Assume we have some components and consistently we are performance the changes so we need to check how react acts or performs.

JSX 
====
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

JSX allows us to write HTML code in JavaScript.

JSX elements contain tags, attributes and childrens.

JSX is not neccessity to develop react application instead we can use babel.

JSX makes our code simple and elegant.

Ultimately JSX transpiled to pure javascript which is understand by a browser.

JSX Elements 
============
JSX allows us to declare HTML elements and insert in a DOM without using createElement() method and appendChild() method.

ex:
---
	JSX
	----	
		<h1> Heading Tag </h1>
	Babel 
	----	
		React.createElement("h1",null,"Heading Tag");

		Here 
		"h1" is a tag name 
		"null" is a optional attribute 
		"Heading Tag" is a children 

ex:
---
	JSX
	---
		<div>
			<h1> Heading Tag </h1>
		</div>
	Babel
	-----
		React.createElement("div",null,
			React.createElement("h1",null,"Heading Tag"));
		
ex:
---
	JSX
	---
		<h1 id="myId"> Heading Tag </h1>

	Babel
	-----
		React.createElement("h1",{id:"myId"},"Heading Tag");


ex:
---
	JSX
	---
		<h1 className="myClass"> Heading Tag </h1>

	Babel
	-----
		React.createElement("h1",{class:"myClass"},"Heading Tag");


JSX Expression 
==============
JSX contains expression in curly braces i.e {}.

JSX expression can be variable, property or any valid javascript expression.

ex:
	var a=10;
	{a}

	`the value is = ${a}`

	{Math.ceil(10.6);}

	var a=10,b=20;
	{a+b}


NPM 
=====
NPM stands for Node Package Manager.

It is a integrated tool for nodejs.

NPM is used to install node packages.

To install node packages we need to use below command.

ex:
	npm install -g <package_name>

All node packages installed in "node_modules" folder.


Environmental Setup for ReactJS 
===============================
step1:
-----
	Download and Install NodeJS software.
	ex:
		https://nodejs.org/en/download

step2:
-----
	Copy the below directories.
	ex:
		C:\Program Files\nodejs
		C:\Users\Quality Thought\AppData\Roaming\npm
step3:
------
	Paste NodeJS and NPM directory in environmental variables.
	ex:
		Right click to This PC --> properties --> Advanced System Settings -->
		Environmental variables --> user variables --> click to Path --> 
		click to edit ---> new  --> copy C:\Program Files\nodejs and 
		C:\Users\Quality Thought\AppData\Roaming\npm --> ok --> ok --> ok.

step4:
-----
	Check environmental setup done perfectly or not.
	ex:
		cmd> node -v 
		cmd> npm -v
