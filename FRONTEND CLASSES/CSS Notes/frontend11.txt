CSS position property
=====================
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).

The following are the list of values to position property.

static 
---------------
	It is default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow 	

absolute 
--------------
	The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element 	
fixed 	
-----------
	The element is positioned relative to the browser window 	
relative 
-------------
	The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels 	to the element's LEFT position.
 	
sticky 	
-----------
	The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position 


css position property mandatory should have following properties.
i)left
ii)right
